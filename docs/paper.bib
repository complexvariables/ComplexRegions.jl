  issn = {0036-1429, 1095-7170},
  abstract = {A new method is introduced for solving Laplace problems on two-dimensional regions with corners by approximation of boundary data by the real part of a rational function with fixed poles exponentially clustered near each corner. Greatly extending a result of D. J. Newman in 1964 in approximation theory, we first prove that such approximations can achieve root-exponential convergence for a wide range of problems, all the way up to the corner singularities. We then develop a numerical method to compute approximations via linear least-squares fitting on the boundary. Typical problems are solved in {$<$} 1s on a desktop to 8-digit accuracy, with the accuracy guaranteed in the interior by the maximum principle. The computed solution is represented globally by a single formula, which can be evaluated in a few microseconds at each point.},
