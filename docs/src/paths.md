# Paths

A **path** is a sequence of curves that compose a continuous complex-valued path.

## [Abstract interface](@id interface_paths)

### AbstractPath

Every `AbstractPath` type is expected to provide the following method:

- `curves(P)`: Return an array of the curves constituting `P`.

In addition, default implementations are given for the following methods.

| Method | Description |
|:-----|:-----|
| `curve(P, k::Integer)`| `k`th curve of `P`.
| `vertices(P)` | Vertices of `P` (the endpoints of the constituent curves) |
| `vertex(P, k::Integer)`| `k`th vertex of `P`. |
| `length(P)`| Number of curves in the path. |
| `isfinite(P)`| True if the path is bounded. |
| `point(P, t::Real)` | Point on the path. |
| `point(P, t::AbstractVector)`| Vectorization of `point`. |
| `tangent(P, t::Real)` | Complex-valued tangent at a point. |
| `unittangent(P, t::Real)`| Normalized tangent at a point. |
| `normal(P, t::Real)`| Leftward-pointing unit normal at a point. |
| `conj(P)`| Complex conjugate of the path. |
| `reverse(P)`| Reverse the orientation of the path. |
| `+,-,*,/`| Translate, rotate and scale a path. |
| `isapprox(P1, P2)` | Determine whether two values represent the same path. |
| `arclength(P)` | Arc length of the path. |
| `dist(z, P)` | Distance from a point to the path. |
| `closest(z, P)`| Point on the path nearest to a given number. |

#### Iterator interface

The `AbstractPath` type implements the `eltype`, `length`, `getindex`, and `iterate` methods of the standard Julia iterator interface. Therefore, clauses such as `for c in P` will iterate over the curves in `P` for loops, comprehensions, and generators.

### AbstractClosedPath

The `AbstractClosedPath` subtype modifies a few of the implementations above:

| Method | Description |
|:-----|:-----|
| `vertices(P)`| Only the unique vertices; i.e., does not duplicate the initial/final vertex. |
| `curve(P, k)` | `k`th curve of the path in a circular/modulo sense. |
| `vertex(P, k)`| `k`th vertex of the path in a circular/modulo sense. |
| `point`, `tangent`, `unittangent`, `normal`| Use a circular/modulo interpretation of the parameter. |

The `AbstractClosedPath` type also has default implementations for the following methods:

| Method | Description |
|:-----|:-----|
| `winding(P, z)` | Winding number of `P` about `z`. |
| `isinside(z, P)` | Detect whether `z` lies inside the path. |
| `isoutside(z, C)` | Detect whether `z` lies outside the path. |

## Generic types

There are generic implementations of both of the abstract types described above.

### Path

`Path` implements the `AbstractPath` type. A path is created by calling `Path(c)`, where `c` is a vector of curves subtyped from `AbstractCurve`. The constructor tests the endpoints of the given curves for continuity up to a selectable tolerance.

### ClosedPath

`ClosedPath` implements the `AbstractClosedPath` type. Its chief difference from the `Path` type is that the constructor also checks whether the initial and final points coincide (up to tolerance). As a subtype of `AbstractClosedPath`, this type also inherits the use of circular/modulo addressing for curve selection and parameterization.

## [Examples](@id examples_paths)

```@setup examples
using ComplexRegions
```

Here is a path defined by arcs and segments.
```@example examples
a = Arc(-1, 1, -1im)
right = Path([4 + 1im+a, 4-1im - 1im*a])
s = Segment(-3+1im, 3+1im)
p = ClosedPath([s, right..., -s, -right...])
arclength(p)
vertices(p)

using ComplexPlots, Plots
plot(cispi(1/4) * p, label="bone")
savefig("bone.svg"); nothing # hide
```
