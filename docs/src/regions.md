# Regions

A **region** is the open set on one side of a closed curve or closed path.

## [Abstract interface](@id interface_regions)

An `AbstractRegion` is expected to provide the following methods. Here `R` is an `AbstractRegion` and `z` is a number.

| Method | Description |
|:-----|:-----|
| `boundary(R)` | Boundary curve(s)/path(s) of a region. |
| `in(z,R)` | Determine whether `z` is in `R`. |
| `isfinite(R)` | Determine whether the region is bounded. |

There are default implementations of the following methods.

| Method | Description |
|:-----|:-----|
| `intersect(R1,R2)` or `R1 ∩ R2` | Intersection of two regions. (Currently a stub for further development.) |
| `union(R1,R2)` or `R1 ∪ R2` | Union of two regions. (Currently a stub for further development.) |

There is also a parametric subtype `AbstractConnectedRegion{N}` used to represent a region of connectivity `N`. Any implementation is expected to provide the following methods.

| Method | Description |
|:-----|:-----|
| `outerboundary(R)` | Curve/path of the outermost boundary, if it exists. |
| `innerboundary(R)` | Curve(s)/path(s) of inner boundaries (that `R` is exterior to). |

Default implementations are provided for  `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, performing translation, rotation, and scaling.

`AbstractSimplyConnectedRegion` is an alias for `AbstractConnectedRegion{1}`.

## Generic types

### SimplyConnectedRegion

Type `SimplyConnectedRegion` is a union of parameterized types `InteriorSimplyConnectedRegion{T}` and `ExteriorSimplyConnectedRegion{T}`, where `T` is a subtype of a union of `AbstractClosedCurve` and `AbstractClosedPath`. The preferred method for constructing a value of one of these types is to use `interior` and `exterior`, respectively, with a closed curve or path as argument. If the given curve is bounded, these constructors ignore its orientation and select the bounded or unbounded region it defines, respectively. For an unbounded boundary curve, points "to the left" of it are considered the interior.

In addition to the methods of the [Abstract interface](@ref interface_regions), the  `SimplyConnectedRegion` type provides the following methods.

| Method | Description |
|:-----|:-----|
| `!(R)` | Complement of `R`.
| `isapprox(R1, R2)` | Determine whether `R1` and `R2` represent the same region. |

The `SimplyConnectedRegion` type is parameterized by the type of curve bounding it in order to facilitate dispatch. Notably included are the definitions

```julia
AbstractDisk = SimplyConnectedRegion{T} where T<:Circle
AbstractHalfplane = SimplyConnectedRegion{T} where T<:Line
PolygonalRegion = SimplyConnectedRegion{Polygon}
```

There are also methods to facilitate construction of important common regions. For disks there are

- `disk(C::Circle)`
- `disk(center, radius)`
- `unitdisk`

For half-planes there are

- `halfplane(L::Line)`
- `upperhalfplane`
- `lowerhalfplane`
- `lefthalfplane`
- `righthalfplane`

### ExteriorRegion

The parameterized type `ExteriorRegion{N}` represents a region lying exterior to `N` closed curves or paths. It is constructed by `ExteriorRegion(inner)`, where `inner` is a vector of closed curves/paths. These are returned by `innerboundary`, and `outerboundary` returns `nothing`.

### ConnectedRegion

The parameterized type `ConnectedRegion{N}` represents a region of connectivity `N`. You construct one by calling `ConnectedRegion{N}(outer, inner)`, where `outer` (if given) is an outer boundary, possibly unbounded, and `inner` is a vector of disconnected inner boundary components. Some rudimentary checking is done that a valid region of connectivity `N` has been specified, but it should not be considered rigorous.

The particular case of a doubly connected region can be constructed by `between(outer, inner)`, giving the two boundary components. The given orientation is ignored for any bounded component.

## [Specific subtypes](@id subtypes_regions)

### Annulus

An `Annulus` is the doubly connected region between two concentric circles. It is a subtype of `AbstractConnectedRegion{2}`. Construction is by `Annulus(outer, inner)`, where [Circle](@ref) values  are given explicitly, or by `Annulus(outrad, inrad, center=0)`, giving the radii and optionally the center.

## Examples

```@setup examples
using ComplexRegions
```

Here is a "dog bone" region.
```@example examples
a = Arc(-1,1,-1im);
right = Path([4+1im+a,4-1im-1im*a]);
s = Segment(-3+1im,3+1im);
p = ClosedPath([s,right...,-s,-right...]);
r = interior(exp(1im*pi/4)*p)

using ComplexPlots, Plots
default(linewidth=2,legend=:none)
plot(r)
savefig("bone-region.svg"); nothing # hide
```

Are you inspired by the Swiss flag?

```@example examples
box = [1-1im, 3-1im, 3+1im];
plus = Polygon([box; 1im*box; -box; -1im*box]);
r = between(rectangle(-6-4im, 6+4im), plus)
plot(r, color=:red, linewidth=0)
savefig("swiss.svg"); nothing # hide
```

A multiply-connected exterior region:

```@example examples
c = Circle(0, 1)
t = n_gon(3)
s = n_gon(4)
plot( ExteriorRegion([c, 3+s, 6+t]) )
savefig("triple.svg"); nothing # hide
```
