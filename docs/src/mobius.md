# Möbius

```@setup examples
using ComplexRegions
```

A **Möbius** transformation (also called bilinear or fractional-linear transformation) is the ratio of two linear polynomials:

$$f(z)=\frac{az+b}{cz+d}.$$

Among other notable properties, they map circles and lines to other circles and lines.

::: tip Alternate spelling

For convenience of typing on some keyboards, `Mobius` is defined as an alias for `Möbius`.

:::

The package defines a `Möbius` type that can be constructed in a variety of ways:

| Construction | Description |
| :----------- | :---------- |
| `Möbius(a, b, c, d)` | Specify the coefficients as in the formula above. |
| `Möbius(A)` | Specify the coefficients as the matrix $A=[a\;b;\;\,c\;d]$. |
| `Möbius(z, w)` | Construct the unique transformation that maps the three points `z[1], z[2], z[3]` to `w[1], w[2], w[3]`, respectively. Either vector of points may include `Inf`. |
| `Möbius(C1, C2)` | Construct a transformation that maps the [Line](@ref) or [Circle](@ref) `C1` to the Line or Circle `C2`. |

## Methods

Suppose `f` is a value of type `Möbius`. Then `f(z)` evaluates the transformation at the number `z`. In addition, `f(C)`, where `C` is a Circle or Line, returns the Circle or Line that is the image of `C` under `f`. Similarly, `f(R)`, where `R` is an `AbstractDisk` or `AbstractHalfplane`, returns the appropriate type of image region. For example,

```@repl examples
f = Möbius(Line(-1, 1), Circle(0, 1))
f(upperhalfplane)
isapprox(ans, unitdisk)
```

Two other methods are defined:

- `inv(f)` Construct the inverse transformation.
- `f∘g` (type "\circ" followed by Tab key) Construct the composed map, $z \mapsto f(g(z))$.
